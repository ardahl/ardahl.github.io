Hello! My name is Alex Dahl. I am a graduate student at the University of Maryland Baltimore County. I did my undergraduate at the University of Minnesota. My research interests are in Computer Graphics and Physics-Based Animation. In particular I'm interested in methods for real-time simulation of various objects. My current research focuses on softbody objects.

I also have an interest in Robotics. During my undergrad I was a member of the UMN robotics student group GOFIRST, where I worked on hardware, electrical, and software for robots for the Intelligent Ground Vehicle Competition and the Autonomous Snowplow Competition, as well as multiple small bots for display and education.

In my free time I enjoy playing tennis and skiing. I competed in both the Slalom and Giant Slalom events in the USCSA on the UMN team during my undergrad.
