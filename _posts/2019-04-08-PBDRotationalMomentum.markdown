Abstract: Position-based dynamics has emerged as a exceedingly popular approach for animating soft body dynamics. Unfortunately, this constraint-based approach suffers from artificial damping. We pro- pose a simple approach to preserve global linear and angular momenta of bodies by directly tracking these quantities and adjusting velocities to ensure they are preserved. This approach entails negligible computational cost, requires less than 25 lines of code, and exactly preserves global linear and angular momenta.
